This document details the approach and findings for the Kaggle "GAN Getting Started Challenge," which focuses on implementing an image-to-image translation system to transform photographs into the distinctive style of Claude Monet. The solution utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, specifically employing a U-Net Generator and a PatchGAN Discriminator. While training was limited to twenty epochs, the model successfully began replicating key stylistic traits, such as blurred object boundaries, by the tenth epoch. However, analysis of the training history revealed instability in the loss curves and early signs of Discriminator overfitting. Therefore, future work is concentrated on performance optimization through hyperparameter tuning, which includes reducing the learning rate and implementing regularization techniques like Dropout, coupled with an essential extension of training epochs to achieve a more stable model and a better final Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score.
